Description: Robust generalized linear models (GLM) using a mixture method, as described in Beath (2018) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2017.1414164>. This assumes that the data are a mixture of standard observations, being a generalised linear model, and outlier observations from an overdispersed generalized linear model. The overdispersed linear model is obtained by including a normally distributed random effect in the linear predictor of the generalized linear model.
